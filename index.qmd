After 22 years of teaching, I have taught many courses and created many iterations of teaching materials. Some of this was "good" and some wasn't. As the progeny of packrats, I saved a lot of these materials, even the garbage. Now, I have finally begun the process of culling this mess and this work-in-progress is the result.

My goal here is to transfer the stuff I feel is reasonable to an online text of sorts. But unlike most texts, this one will likely not be linear, nor perhaps coherent---at least across chapters. If it is useful to you; use whatever you want. If not, ignore it.
